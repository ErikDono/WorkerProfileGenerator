## Node JS and My Thought Process 

    This Profile Creator took some serious thinking, but was very enjoyable! I would have liked to use asynch methods, but the way it works is fine. The majority of my code is separated out into the different occupations, which allowed me to organize things a bit easier. I made separate modules for the questions, as that seemed to fit the flow of the app more. Each occupation has its own set of questions, which needed to match up with the test items. Mine match, yet I am still failing a lot of the tests. This will be talked about in more detail during the test section. I have added my own stylized CSS, as well.

## Installation
      This  uses Inquier and Axios, but you should just be able to run NPM Install 

## Usage
      Users can feel free to put their items in, and make a basic template for thir readme file in their bash/terminal.  

## License:
      1.0.0 

## Tests Used:
      none, but maybe soon! 

## Contribution:
      Feel free to email me, and ask for permission. 

## Bugs:
      You cannot skip either GitHub line, as the axios catch error did not work as intended. Also, you cannot enter more than one contributor at this point.

## Future Deploys:
      I would like to move ask to the questions page, as i know it is possible, and i feel like i came very close. 

      I would also like to make the applciation take in multiple names for contributors. I think it would be a forEach... but i am unsure. 

      I would also like to make a functionable html modlue that will create an hmtl page with the ReadMe's info, so that you can edit it.
