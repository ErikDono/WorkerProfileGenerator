## Node JS and My Thought Process 

    This Profile Creator took some serious thinking, but was very enjoyable! I would have liked to use asynch methods, but the way it works is fine. The majority of my code is separated out into the different occupations, which allowed me to organize things a bit easier. I made separate modules for the questions, as that seemed to fit the flow of the app more. Each occupation has its own set of questions, which needed to match up with the test items. The questions ask for information unique to each occupation, but also ask what occupation they'd like to input next. The app allows the user to stop at either the end point of each input, or if they mistakenly said yes to creating a new employee. So far, my named objects and functions match but I am still failing a lot of the tests. This will be talked about in more detail during the test section. I have added my own stylized CSS, as well. The HTML is generated into an output folder.
